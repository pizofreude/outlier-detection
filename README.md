## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Generation
- Synthetic 2D dataset with clear IND/OOD separation
- Two interlocking half-circles (moons) for in-distribution data
- Gaussian cluster for out-of-distribution data
- Data integrity verification with SHA256 hashing

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Standardization pipeline with train/validation/test splits
- Prevents data leakage and ensures proper scaling
- Configurable scaling methods (Standard, Robust, MinMax)

### 3. Multi-Method Detection
- Statistical methods for baseline comparison
- Advanced ML models for complex pattern detection
- Density-based approaches for likelihood estimation
- Hyperparameter optimization where applicable

### 4. Score Fusion
- Intelligent combination of detector outputs
- Weight optimization using validation data
- Normalized score scaling for fair comparison
- Grid search for optimal fusion parameters

### 5. Comprehensive Evaluation
- Multiple metrics for thorough assessment
- Calibration analysis for reliability
- Benchmark comparison across all methods
- Production-ready performance reporting

## üìà Results and Benchmarking

Results are automatically generated and saved to:
- `results/benchmarks.csv` - Detailed performance metrics
- `results/data_summary.csv` - Dataset statistics
- `results/environment_info.json` - Reproducibility information
- `results/production_recommendations.json` - Deployment guidance

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **AUROC**: Area Under ROC Curve
- **AUPRC**: Area Under Precision-Recall Curve  
- **FPR@95TPR**: False Positive Rate at 95% True Positive Rate
- **ECE**: Expected Calibration Error

## üè≠ Production Deployment

### Recommended Approach
1. **Start Conservative**: Use 95th percentile thresholds initially
2. **Monitor Closely**: Track false positive rates and business impact
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Review high uncertainty cases manually
4. **Regular Maintenance**: Monthly threshold tuning and model updates

### Alert Configuration
- **LOW**: 75th percentile threshold, 24h review SLA
- **MEDIUM**: 90th percentile threshold, 4h review SLA
- **HIGH**: 95th percentile + uncertainty, immediate review
- **CRITICAL**: 99th percentile, immediate escalation

### Monitoring Strategy
- Daily anomaly count tracking
- Feature importance analysis
- Model drift detection
- Performance degradation alerts

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
Run the built-in unit tests:
```python
# Tests are automatically executed in the notebook
# Or run separately: python -m pytest tests/test_outlier_detection.py -v
```

### Integration Testing
The notebook includes a complete integration test that verifies:
- Data generation consistency
- Model training pipeline
- Score fusion functionality
- Evaluation metrics calculation

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Detectors
1. Implement detector following sklearn-compatible API
2. Add to evaluation pipeline in benchmarking section
3. Update score fusion system to include new method
4. Add unit tests for new functionality

### Modifying Thresholds
- Adjust contamination parameters in detector initialization
- Update alert severity levels in production recommendations
- Retrain fusion weights with new threshold preferences

### Custom Data
- Replace synthetic data generation with your data loading code
- Ensure proper train/validation/test splits
- Update feature engineering pipeline as needed
- Verify data integrity and tracking
